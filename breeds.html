                    <h2>American Shorthair</h2>
                    <p id="american">Friendly, personable, and easy to care for, the American Shorthair cat shares many things in common with the domestic shorthair. The main difference is that American Shorthair cats always share common characteristics with one another, while domestic shorthair cats display various trades from the breeds in their backgrounds.

                    <h2>British Shorthair</h2>
                    <p id="british">These cats love their families and enjoy staying close, but they aren't big on cuddling. They prefer to lounge next to you rather than occupying your lap, and they aren't terribly demanding or overly vocal. British Shorthair cats make excellent pets for most households, but they don't tolerate disrespect, and they don't like to be held or carried.    </p>

                    <h2>Siamese</h2>
                    <p id="siamese">If you've been looking for a cat that likes to talk back to you, consider the Siamese. Among the most vocal of all breeds, these chatty cats love nothing more than to spend time alongside their favorite people, eagerly offering advice and opinions about everything that happens throughout the day.
                    <br>
                    Talkative tendencies are just the beginning. Siamese cats are friendly and playful, with the ability to get along well with just about everyone as long as they are properly socialized as kittens.

                    <h2>Bengal</h2>
                    <p id="bengal">Playful and active, Bengal cats are excellent pets. Quite a bit less standoffish then some other wildcat hybrids, these incredible cats enjoy affection and develop close bonds with their family members. Although they might be up for a cuddle now and then, Bengal cats are anything but couch potatoes. This highly active breed needs a lot of daily activity and play to thrive.

                    <h2>Persian</h2>
                    <p id="persian">If you're looking for a cat that isn't into impressive displays of athleticism, the Persian might be the perfect breed for you. These cats love to lounge, particularly after they reach adulthood. Not prone to excessive mischief, Persians are quiet and well-behaved pets. However, they are intelligent cats, capable of learning your routine, greeting you, and of course, curling up for snuggles as part of a daily routine.</p>

                    <h2>Exotic Shorthair</h2>
                    <p id="exotic">Friendly toward newcomers and affectionate toward family members, these cats adore their people and enjoy nothing quite so much as the attention of their human companions. They are fond of cuddling – so much so, that it's not at all uncommon for them to climb under the covers with their favorite person. Exotic Shorthair cats do enjoy playtime, but they typically play in a gentler, slower manner than the average cat.

                    <h2>Sphynx</h2>
                    <p id="sphynx">If you’re looking for a friendly cat with a big personality, the Sphynx might be ideal. Bonus points if you’re hoping for a pet that doesn’t shed, as these hairless cats are either completely free of hair or are covered in the barest layer of fine, velvety down.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Bombay</h2>
                    <p id="bombay">As family pets go, Bombay cats are outstanding. Rather than bonding with a single individual, they are affectionate toward everyone they know – and they have a tendency to get along well with other pets.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Siberian</h2>
                    <p id="siberian">Intelligent and playful, the Siberian cat loves to give and receive affection. These adorable kitties live to spend their days and nights alongside their favorite people, often chatting in melodic voices that have nothing in common with the harsher vocalizations of other talkative breeds such as the Siamese.
