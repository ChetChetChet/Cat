            This is the most common cat breed you’ll find in the Philippines. Not just in the home, though, but also roaming the streets, enjoying all the attention they can get as they play or hunt.

Puspin is short for Pusang Pinoy or Pinoy Cat, and they have no specific origin or breed standards.

Due to the mongrel nature of the Puspin, there aren’t any average heights and weights, as it varies from cat to cat. 

They can also have a variety of coat colors but generally keep their short hair- which is among the only standards to be found within the group of cats.

There is growing interest within the Philippines to deem this a specific breed rather than an “other” category, though purists continue to resist.
