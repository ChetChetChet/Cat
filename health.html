                    <h2>Flea</h2>
                    <p>Cat fleas carry diseases and cause skin irritation and allergic reactions in cats. The cat flea life cycle takes anywhere from 2 weeks to 1 year, depending on the climate.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Suggested Treatment</h3>
                    <p>Pesky fleas can be difficult to get rid of. Fleas can live up to more than a year in certain climates. But, there are three simple solutions to get rid of your cat's flea problem for good.
                    <br>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Apply flea & tick treatment.</li>
                        <li>Clean your home.</li>
                        <li>Use a household spray.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Tapeworm</h2>
                    <p>Tapeworms are common intestinal parasites that affect indoor and outdoor cats. Tapeworms infest a cat's intestinal tract when a cat ingests an intermediate host like fleas or rodents.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Suggested Treatment</h3>
                    <p>Tapeworm spreads through fleas. So, the best way to protect your cat is by using a preventative flea control treatment.
                    <br>
                    <br>If your cat does contract tapeworm, the main method of treatment is through deworming medication. Deworming medications prescribed by your vet are safe for cats. And, they are effective at getting rid of tapeworms.
                    <br>

                    <h2>Dental disease</h2>
                    <p>Dental diseases that affect your cat's teeth and gums are common as they grow older in age. This is due to the gradual wear and tear of their teeth. Here are some clinical signs that your cat may be suffering from dental disease:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Red and swollen gums.</li>
                            <li>Pawing at the mouth.</li>
                            <li>Refusal to eat hard food.</li>
                        </ul>
                    If you suspect your cat might have dental health issues, visit your vet for a cat check-up.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Suggested Treatment</h3>
                    <p>The most common forms of dental disease are preventative and treatable. Brushing your cat's teeth every two weeks can help prevent plaque buildup.

                    <br><br>If your cat has a dental disease, managing your cat's pain is the first step of treatment. To ease pain and discomfort, your vet may suggest removing the damaged tooth. Removing a damaged tooth will also prevent the condition from spreading to other teeth.
                    <br>
                    
                    <h2>Feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD)</h2>

                    <p>One of the more common cat health problems is FLUTD. FLUTD occurs when there is a defect in the structure or function of your cat's bladder. When your cat's bladder is not structured correctly, it can cause problems in your cat's life.

                    <br><br>UTIs in cats, inflammation, and diet are the most common causes of lower urinary tract diseases. Because there are many causes of FLUTD, the origin of the disease can be difficult to diagnose.
                    <br><br>
                    The most common signs of FLUTD include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Painful urination.</li>
                            <li>Frequent urination.</li>
                            <li>Inappropriate urination.</li>
                            <li>Bloody urine.</li>
                            <li>Frequent licking of the genital area.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Suggested Treatment</h3>
                    <p>                        <ul>
                        <li>Fluid therapy.</li>
                        <li>Dietary improvements.</li>
